# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is an AI game development project named "ai-game-1" that explores using AI to build a small game. The repository is currently in its initial state with minimal structure.

## Repository Structure

This is a new repository with only basic files:
- `README.md` - Basic project description
- `.git/` - Git repository metadata

## Development Workflow

Since this is a new project without established tooling or build processes, future development will need to establish:
- Choice of programming language and framework for the game
- Build and development scripts
- Testing framework and commands
- Project structure and architecture

## Notes for Future Development

- This is a greenfield project - technology stack and architecture decisions need to be made
- No existing build tools, package managers, or development workflows are configured
- Consider the target platform (web, desktop, mobile) when setting up the development environment
